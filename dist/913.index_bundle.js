Today, the vast majority of what we consume is produced by a network of large, geographically dispersed corporations. In barely two centuries, the self-sufficient peasant community has vanished, giving way to a myriad of urban, connected consumers. This book traces the major stages of this shift towards consumerism. How was market power established? What social changes accompanied the mass circulation of goods? By exploring 19th- and 20th-century Europe and North America, this book recounts the history of numerous market mechanisms: the brand imbuing merchandise with its symbolic value, the elaborate displays created by department stores, the symbolic engineering deployed by public relations and advertising... It tells the story of the population's conversion to consumerism and the meteoric rise to power of merchants."})]})]}),(0,a.jsxs)("div",{className:"book-card",children:[(0,a.jsx)("div",{className:"card-img",children:(0,a.jsx)("a",{href:"https://www.deslegte.com/lieve-stine-weet-jij-het-429952/",target:"_blank",children:(0,a.jsx)("img",{src:"https://www.deslegte.com/images/cached/resample/webp/data/uploads/407/514/cms_visual_233444.jpg_1429070621000_407x514_0.8_p-6bf8df2e47.webp",alt:"Lieve Stine, weet jij het?"})})}),(0,a.jsxs)("div",{className:"intro",children:[(0,a.jsx)("h3",{children:"Lieve Stine, weet jij het?"}),(0,a.jsx)("h5",{children:"Stine Jensen"}),(0,a.jsx)("p",{children:"Debut children's book by philosopher Stine Jensen Finally, another accessible philosophy book for young adults Why do I have to go to school when I'd rather play outside?

The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast. But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails."})]})]})]})})]})}}}]);
